=========

DeLPhy (Deep Learning for Physics) is a set of deep learning algorithms with focus on High Energy Physics.

## Setup

+ This project is built on `Ubuntu 14.04`.

+ In order to run the code on Nvidia GPU, please install CUDA Toolkit.

+ General dependencies before running the code:

   ```
   Python 2.7.8
